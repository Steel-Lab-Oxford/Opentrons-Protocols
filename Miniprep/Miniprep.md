## Protocol

### Day 1

Grow 24 2ml cultures in 14ml snap cap tubes overnight 

### Day 2

1. Set up Opentrons deck with tips, tube racks and vacuum manifold as required in the miniprep protocol 
    
    Rack for cells: B2
    
    Vacuum manifold: B3
    
    Buffers in 50ml falcons: C2 
    
    Rack for elutions: C3
    
    **Note:** transfer around 10ml of lysis and neutralisation buffer, 25ml of Wash buffer and 2ml of Elution buffer to falcon tubes and add to rack in order: Lysis in A1, neutralisation in A2, Wash in A3, Elution in B1 
    
2. Transfer cultures to 2ml eppendorf tubes and spin down 6,800 × g for 2 minutes
3. Resuspend pellet in 250 μL Resuspension Solution (ensure RNase A has been added)
4. Rack resuspended cells in the Opentrons in deck slot B2
5. Start Opentrons miniprep protocol 
6. Opentrons will pause after neutralisation (1.5 hours) for you to spin down the cell debris, spin down at >12,000g for 5 minutes and then transfer lysate to spin columns on top of vacuum manifold 
7. restart opentrons and turn vacuum on 
8. Opentrons will pause when wash step is complete (1.5 hours) , turn off vacuum and transfer spin columns to elution 1.5ml eppies 
9. (Optional) Spin down at >12,000g for 1 minute to remove residual ethanol 
10. Transfer tubes to rack in C3 and restart opentrons 
11. After 10 mins return to freeze samples
